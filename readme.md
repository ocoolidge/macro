# H1 Macroeconomics Model Visualizations

# H2 GDP

# H3 GDP Expenditure Side
Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditure + (Exports - Imports)

# H3 GDP Income Side
wages and salaries + interest and profits + depreciation + (indirect taxes - subsidies)

# H3 in an economy with no government or taxation:
AE = C + I
national income Y = aggregate disposable income Yd
saving = disposable income not spent on consumption
Y = actual national income
Y = equilibrium national income when Y = AE
I is not affected by current level of GDP (I is autonomous)

# H3 Consumption function:
Yd = Disposable income
C = Desired Consumption
S = Desired saving
C/Yd = Average propensity to consume (APC) - proportion of disposable income that households want to consume
(change in C)/(change in Yd) = Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) - how much of one addiitonal dollar of income gets spent on consumption.
S/Yd = Average Propensity to save (APS) - proportion of disposable income that households want to save
(change in S)/(change in Yd) = marginal propensity to save (MPS) - relates the change in desired saving to the change in disposable income that brought it about
APC + APS = 1
MPC + MPS = 1
simple multiplier = (Y change/A change) change in actual national income divided by change in autonomous expenditure

# H3 Adding government and trade:
G is part of aggregate desired expenditure
G is autonomous
where Y is GDP nad t is net tax rate
T = tY
Yd = Y - T (disposable income equals income minus taxes)
m = marginal propensity to import
Y = GDP
IM = mY
NX = X - mY

# H2 All together:
AE = C + I + G + (X - IM)
AE = c + MPC(1 - t)Y + I + G + (X - mY)
AE = autonomous expenditure + induced expenditure = [c + I + G + X] + [MPC(1 - t) - m]Y
z = MPC(1 - t) - m


# H2 TO FRED:
Yd = disposable personal income (DSPI)
S = personal saving (PMSAVE)
APS = S/Yd = Average propensity to save
APC = 1 - APS = Average propensity to consume
C = APC*Yd = Desired Consumption
MPC = changeC/changeYd
MPS = changeS/changeYd = 1 - MPC
m = IM/GDP
c = C - MPC(Yd)
C = c + MPC(Yd)
